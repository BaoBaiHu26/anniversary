                We aint even that close in 1st year of our uni life, in 2nd year, a lil bit close since we had gone
                trips tgt (not to mention some of your rs bumps xD), then <em>3rd year</em>
                thanks to them, we
                both got fked up and got rlly closer than before, 4th year was a lil bit awkward cause you were busy
                liking another girl üòè and flipping your character to the opposite <em>(ps i really like you with that
                    white
                    shirt and pasoe era),</em> and lastly never ending 5th year since we never got to the final year

                5th year had been a lot fun, we ditched classes and hung out all the time, good times aint it? The
                christmas night, the day we went to the zoo, the football tournaments and the valentine‚Äôs day, we
                got close again and lastly, the picture we took tht in the football field got really popular among
                our circle and got shipped publicly lmao.

                We joined TPH then covid started and the coup, those years passed rlly quick. and all the absurd
                drama happened. you got close to httk and idk how it went by. Here, i still wanna say sorry that I
                couldnt stay by my side esp when you needed smo. We rarely talked abt it cause it is almost like a
                taboo but srsly babe, I am sorry. even with your happy-go-lucky personality, I know that was
                unbearable and I couldnt even imagine how you went through those months. Thanks to that personality,
                we got to keep this squad so thank you ü´∂üèª After that, HubnHack comes along and you know what
                happened hehe.

                Over 6 years of friendship + 1 year of relationship huh! That is not a small amount of time to still be
                wanting to be by each other‚Äôs side, not to mention BKK and YGN thing. We have fought, stopped talking to
                each other, flirted with each
                other, and given rs advice to each other. Literally, who would have thought we would end up tgt, lmao.
                I, for one, didn‚Äôt have that idea. TBH I had thought how we would be in a rs in my third year, but the
                ending I could imagine was really from this real one.

                we will be okay along the journey, right?
